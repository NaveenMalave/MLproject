#Minor Project
• Project Name:
Machine Learning June Minor Project
• Project Description:
Perform classification analysis to predict how many people survived the titanic disaster
using Logistic regression for the given dataset. 
The dataset can be downloaded from the below given link. 
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv 
Also plot visuals by using Matplotlib/Seaborn data visualization comparing the different 
features of the input parameters and do Exploratory data analysis (EDA) by using 
pandas.

# MAJOR PROJECT
• Project Name:
Machine Learning June Major Project
• Project Description:
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - Sentiment analysis studies the subjective information in an
expression, that is, the opinions, appraisals, emotions, or attitudes towards a topic, person or
entity. Expressions can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. For example: “I really like
the new design of your website!” → Positive.
• You are provided with a dataset of the ‘restaurant review’ taken from kaggle. Build a
machine learning model by using Support vector classifier(SVM) and count vectorizer using
two
methods(direct method, pipeline method) to predict the label of the review either as positive
or negative.
• Also use MultinomialNB (Naïve bayes) and count vectorizer using two methods(direct
method, pipeline method) to classifiy if the sentiment is positive or negative and compare the
accuracies of all 4 models of the models

• [[NOTE :There are two features - ‘review’ - the sentence and ‘sentiment’ - the label for the
review. 1 means positive review and 0 means negative review.]]
